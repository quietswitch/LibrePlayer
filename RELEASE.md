# LocalTracklist Release Procedure

LocalTracklist is published by quietswitch and was formerly named LibrePlayer. Published v1.0.4 and v1.1.0 releases keep their original names and artifacts. The controlled rebrand retains version 1.1.0/code 6 for review only; the next release version is a separate decision. Do not sign or publish a new APK as part of this rebrand.

This procedure produces and verifies a signed LocalTracklist APK without placing signing material in the repository. Commands are for Windows PowerShell and must be run from the repository root.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 available to Gradle
- Android SDK Platform 36
- A recent Android SDK Build Tools package containing `zipalign` and `apksigner`
- Android SDK Platform Tools containing `adb`
- Secure, non-repository storage for a private Android release keystore and its backup
- A connected Android 8.0 (API 26) or newer device for installation and manual acceptance checks

Use placeholders such as `<ANDROID_SDK>`, `<BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION>`, `<SECURE_KEYSTORE_PATH>`, and `<KEY_ALIAS>` locally. Do not replace them with private values in tracked files.

## Preserve the Permanent Signing Identity

The permanent release key already exists. Reuse that same key and certificate for LocalTracklist updates; do not generate a replacement for the rebrand. The initial key-creation instructions below are retained for historical reference only. The signing certificate is visible to anyone who inspects a released APK, so its subject must not contain a legal name, personal email address, organization, location, or other identifying information. Use only the public pseudonym `quietswitch` where an identity is required.

Create the key outside the repository and let `keytool` request its passwords interactively:

```powershell
keytool -genkeypair -v `
    -keystore '<SECURE_KEYSTORE_PATH>' `
    -alias '<KEY_ALIAS>' `
    -keyalg RSA `
    -keysize 4096 `
    -validity 10000 `
    -dname 'CN=quietswitch'
```

Choose a non-identifying alias. Do not put passwords in the command, a properties file, shell history, or this repository. Inspect the certificate before release and confirm that its owner/subject contains only the intended pseudonym.

## Clean Verification

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean --console=plain
.\gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest --console=plain
.\gradlew.bat lintDebug --console=plain
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug --console=plain
.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease --console=plain
git diff --check
git status --short
```

The unsigned release APK is expected at:

```text
app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release-unsigned.apk
```

## Align and Sign

The example below retains the historical `LibrePlayer-1.1.0.apk` filename; it is not an instruction to overwrite or republish that release. Choose a LocalTracklist artifact name only after the next release version is decided. Set temporary PowerShell variables for the local session. The keystore path and alias shown here are placeholders:

```powershell
$buildTools = Join-Path '<ANDROID_SDK>' 'build-tools\<BUILD_TOOLS_VERSION>'
$unsignedApk = '.\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release-unsigned.apk'
$alignedApk = '.\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release-aligned.apk'
$signedApk = '.\app\build\outputs\apk\release\LibrePlayer-1.1.0.apk'
$keyStore = '<SECURE_KEYSTORE_PATH>'
$keyAlias = '<KEY_ALIAS>'

& (Join-Path $buildTools 'zipalign.exe') -p -f 4 $unsignedApk $alignedApk
& (Join-Path $buildTools 'apksigner.bat') sign --ks $keyStore --ks-key-alias $keyAlias --out $signedApk $alignedApk
```

Allow `apksigner` to request passwords interactively. Do not place passwords on the command line, in PowerShell history, in Gradle properties, or in repository files.

## Verify the Signed APK

```powershell
& (Join-Path $buildTools 'apksigner.bat') verify --verbose --print-certs $signedApk
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 $signedApk
```

Record the SHA-256 value next to the distributed artifact through the chosen release channel.

## Install

Use the `adb` executable from the local Android SDK:

```powershell
$adb = Join-Path '<ANDROID_SDK>' 'platform-tools\adb.exe'
& $adb devices
& $adb install $signedApk
```

For a later update signed with the same permanent key, use `adb install -r`. A debug-signed installation cannot be updated in place by a release-signed APK; use a separate device/profile for acceptance or uninstall the debug build only after accepting the loss of its local app data.

## Manual Acceptance Checklist

- Install or update succeeds on a supported Android device.
- The app launches and requests only the expected audio permission.
- MediaStore songs appear after permission is granted.
- Optional folder import uses the system picker and imports the selected folder.
- A song plays, pauses, seeks, and advances through the queue.
- Shuffle and repeat behave as selected.
- Notification, lock-screen, headset, or Bluetooth controls operate during background playback.
- Now Playing handles multiline title and artist text without overlapping controls.
- Favorites, playlists, settings, queue, and playback position survive an app restart.
- Airplane-mode playback works and no network permission appears in app details.

## Signing-Key Protection

- Keep the keystore, alias, and passwords outside the repository and outside shared build artifacts.
- Store the keystore in encrypted primary storage with at least one encrypted offline backup.
- Store passwords separately from the keystore and limit access to the release owner.
- Never commit signing properties, shell transcripts containing credentials, or signed-key backups.
- Preserve the same release key for future updates; losing it can prevent compatible update distribution.
- Before publishing, inspect `apksigner verify --verbose --print-certs` output and confirm that the certificate exposes only the `quietswitch` identity.
- Verify backups periodically without copying private material into the project directory.
